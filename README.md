## Key Insights

  *Action*: Review cost structures and discount policies for top-selling, unprofitable SKUs.

- **Discounts in the 70–80% range consistently produce negative profit across multiple items**, including both high- and low-ticket products.  
  *Action*: Introduce a strategic discounting threshold and reassess promotional pricing.

- **The Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier stands out as the strongest single-product performer, generating over ₹25K in pure profit**.  
  *Action*: Prioritize this product in marketing, bundling, and inventory strategy to maximize returns.

- **The Consumer segment delivers the highest total sales and profit among all customer types**, far outperforming Corporate and Home Office segments.
